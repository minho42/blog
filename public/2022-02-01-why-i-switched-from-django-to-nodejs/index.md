### or why I'm learning nodejs

from a hobby dev point of view

### why django -> nodejs
- **have to deal with javascript anyway**
- **native async support vs non trivial hard-to-grasp-async**
- context switching between python and javascript
- scrapings are much faster: async vs sync, puppeteer vs selenium
- seems like there are more resources on web development in js
- creating/activating virtual environment every time vs npm
  - even with the alias: alias project='cd /Users/.../project && source venv/bin/activate'
- faster/auto server reloading vs slow/manual
- got used to javascript: overcame the hurdle of callbacks, brackets

### why I wnat to go back to django
- **miss django ORM**
- love python
- felt much more productive when using django
- debugging seems straighforward with django
- feels more secure
