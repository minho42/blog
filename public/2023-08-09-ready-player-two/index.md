As soon as I finished [*Ready Player One*](/posts/2023-06-25-ready-player-one),
reading the sequel, *Ready Player Two*, has begun immediately.
I was so intrigued to see what the author could come up with in the world where *Parzival* and friends already won the contest and can live happily ever after.

Although I had been reading this 2020-follow-up novel quite consistently, it took more than a month to finish.
Not unusual. But considering the first one took about 2 weeks, it tells something.
For one, I am not a native English reader and read slowly.
And I look up words a lot as I read along.
But the main reason was because I didn't relate to the plot line, and got bored in the middle of the story.

Especially, the restriction in the OASIS Neural Interface (ONI) usage didn't seem very well-though-out.
Which somewhat lost my immersion into the new challenges in the OASIS.
Also many references weren't particularly of my interests in this book e.g. J. R. R. Tolkien, etc.

Even though I didn't enjoy the sequel as much as the original, the series has plenty of creative ideas planted throughout.
I'm looking forward to the film sequel that is reportedly in the works.
