I, age 40, used to say "age is just a number".
I don't remember when I last said that.

Now that I'm in my 40s, "age is **not** just a number". 
My mind has aged pretty rapidly than I thought it ever would.
Approaching midlife, I can feel the heaviness of my "numbers" in my body and mind.
It could be just me who nearly abandoned my health, but I presume same is true for most of the people in their 40s and onwards.
