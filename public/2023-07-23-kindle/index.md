### 👍 Pros of Kindle
- battery lasts really long
- less distraction
- e-ink is reportedly better for the eyes although I don't really notice myself
- e-ink is good under the sun (with sunglasses on too)
- good in the dark: brightness can be adjusted much dimmer than iPhone 
- lighter

### 👎 Cons of Kindle
- bigger than iPhone
- you carry Kindle and likely your phone too likely end up carrying more device
- terribly slow: page turning, dictionary lookup, amazon book search becomes unbearably sometimes
- syncing is not satisfying if switching devices

### 👍 Pros of iPhone
- readily available which is essential to read consistently
- higher screen resolution
- plus all the other perks of using smartphone: e.g. search, notes app, etc.

### 👎 Cons of iPhone
- much distraction; my overcoming strategy would be to intentionally open Kindle app on iPhone when picking up a phone to check something instead of social media apps like Twitter. If I open Kindle first at least I read one line which is my goal for a day then I would check social apps anyway, but opposite is not true if social apps are checked first.
- supposedly causes more strain on the eyes; again not so noticeable personally
- heavier
- Can't purchase Kindle books on iPhone Kindle app
    > The iOS Kindle app, Android Kindle app, and Amazon app for iOS and Android don't support in-app purchasing for Kindle books. Customers must purchase on a web browser.

### 💡 Requests for iPhone Kindle app
- Always show dictionary within the screen so I don't have to touch-bring-up-to-top when in landscape mode. It's kind of a bug, you know.
- "Reading Ruler" to stay where they were. Reading Ruler can be turned on and work as a bookmark within the page, but this ruler doesn't stay where they were but goes back up on top of the page when returning from other apps or home screen. 

### 🙏 Wish list
- I wish I can read Korean books on Kindle
- I wish Kindle can jump pages more swiftly. Well it hasn't happened for the last 1.5 decade.
