```text
luck = doing x telling
```

The surface area of luck increases with passionate doing and effective telling.

I have been telling around that I would like to build an online business or become an indie hacker.

Years passed.
Still "all talk, no action".

Without "doing", luck would definitely zero out.
It's like multiplying "telling" by 0, which equates to 0.

```text
0 (doing) x telling = 0 (luck)
```

It's embarrassing.
I should keep my mouth shut and do some stuff before telling any more bluffs.
