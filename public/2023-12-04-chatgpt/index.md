ChatGPT was launched on 2022-11-30. 

People around me, non-techies:
- Some don't even know what ChatGPT is.
- Many can't think of ChatGPT's use case outside of homework and essays.
- Some question why to use ChatGPT when they can Google.
- Almost no one uses ChatGPT on a regular basis.

AI is accelerating at a staggering rate, 
but it doesn't seem to have penetrated the general public yet.

Well, I, free GPT-3.5 user, don't even use it to it's full potential myself.
