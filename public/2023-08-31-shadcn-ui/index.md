Recently discovered awesome UI library is [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) by [@shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn).

It's more than components of pre-made collection of Tailwind CSS classes e.g. [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com).
It is built on top of something called [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

> Radix: \
> An open source component library optimized for fast development, easy maintenance, and accessibility.

Radix is an unstyled bare-bones component library, not just the looks and shapes of the components but also focused on accessibility too.
And shadcn/ui is the decorator over the Radix with the Tailwind CSS.

More about shadcn/ui to follow once I actually use it in my project.
