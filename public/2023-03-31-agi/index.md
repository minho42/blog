I would like to make a referential mental note of how I think about AGI here.

My tweet (deleted):

I've always believed something like AGI or singularity wouldn't be achieved in many many decades to come. If it ever happens at all.

However, so many smart people think AGI is definitely going to arrive. This makes me wonder if it's really just a matter of time.

What ChatGPTs and Stable Diffusion are capable of is wondrous magic. Unfathomable became reality.
But like I mentioned in the above tweet, current technologies of AI is nowhere near what I think AGI is.
