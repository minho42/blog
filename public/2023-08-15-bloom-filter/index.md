> A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not â€“ in other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set".

I recently learned about this probabilistic data structure, bloom filter, from watching this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iA-QtVCPjtE) (Korean) by [@charsyam](https://twitter.com/charsyam).

I had a data structure class in university, but I haven't heard about this one. Well I was not a good student.

Thought it would be a good small-coding-excercise-material for my rusty React skills.
Then comes lots of searching and encountering errors just to realise React is not that easy and intuitive, and I don't build things as quick and seamlessly as I wish or thought I could.
If I was given a job of implementing this simple program in an interview, I would've definitely bombed.

Lesson: code more and frequently
