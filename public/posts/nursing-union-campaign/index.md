Nursing union: ["Our campaign for a 15% pay rise"](https://www.nswnma.asn.au/campaigns/ratios4nsw/)

What an unrealistically overambitious campaign is this.

Consider how this hasn't worked for the last 10+ years.
Look at how we suffer short-staffing every day.

There is absolutely no reason for the government to raise our salary that much.
The nursing strike on 24/9/2024 just proved it.
Quite the opposite of "value us".

The union makes over $5M/m from the membership fees.
It seems their incentives are not entirely aligned, as long as the campaigns attracts more members.
