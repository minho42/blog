Renting life in Sydney

## Rent number 14

- Bond paid to [RBO](https://rbo.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/), the middle man, at the start of the lease as usual.
- After the lease ended, real estate agency quoted damages we didn't cause, then requested full bond amount from RBO without any negotiation, negating the purpose of using RBO in the first place.
- **Only way to disagree was to dispute by lodging a claim with [NCAT](https://ncat.nsw.gov.au/).**
- Exchanged a few emails back and forth.
- Reached an agreement to avoid tribunal with a minimal bond deduction for a stain.
- Bond released [1].
- Withdrew NCAT application [2], though the $60 filing fee is non-refundable.

## Conclusion/vent

1. Unfair process of RBO; there's no way to disagree with a non-negotiated bond return request; why not have a "diagree" button?
2. NCAT taking a $60 filing fee for nothing is unreasonable.
3. Moving in/out is extremely stressful.

## Notes

### [1] RBO request cancelling process:

- Both parties:
  1. Reach an agreement on an amended deduction.
  2. Complete the form ("Claim for refund of bond money") and email it to RBO (bondclaims@customerservice.nsw.gov.au).
  3. Submit an online enquiry stating the new deduction amount.
     > (why was this not available on mobile?)

### [2] Withdrawing NCAT application

NCAT application done online, whereas withdrawal required sending a signed PDF form ("Request for withdrawal of application") by email (ccdsydney@ncat.nsw.gov.au). It wasn't easy to find the correct email address for this.
