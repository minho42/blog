title: DCCV defibrillator pad placement

My empirical-based gut feeling:

Anterior-posterior (AP) defibrillator pad placement is superior to anterior-lateral (AL) for elective direct current cardioversion (DCCV).

> Meta-analysis of randomized data showed no difference between AP and AL electrode positions in the success rate of DC cardioversion of AF. Either AP or AL electrode positions should be acceptable approaches for elective DC cardioversion of patients with AF.
