Recently, I have been doing Monday-to-Friday morning shifts only, meaning no shift work penalties.

Suddenly became curious about how close I am to the low-income group.
Turns out my no-penalty-income meets social housing [income eligibility limits](https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/housing/policies/social-housing-eligibility-allocations-policy-supplement/chapters/income):

> ðŸ‘¨ $780  
> ðŸ‘© $295  
> ðŸ‘§ $380  
> ðŸ‘¦ $125  
> = $1580/w

I'm officially low-income.
