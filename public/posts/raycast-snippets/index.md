1. Raycast [Snippets](https://manual.raycast.com/snippets) work just like iPhone text replacement when "keyword" (trigger) is set

2. Snippets can have [Dynamic Placeholder](https://manual.raycast.com/dynamic-placeholders) that can be used e.g. current date & time, etc.

#### Create Snippet:

Raycast -> Create Snippet:

```text
	Name: today
	Snippet: {date "yyyy-MM-dd"}
	Keyword: !today
```

Handy
