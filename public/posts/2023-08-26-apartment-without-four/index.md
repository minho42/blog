["What happened to levels four and 14? Why the Chinese word for 'death' is causing entire FLOORS to disappear from new high-rises in Australia"](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3481168/New-Sydney-apartment-building-deliberately-left-floors-number-four-sounds-similar-death-Chinese.html)

The Sydney apartment I live in has no number four in the lift nor in the unit numbers.

It goes straight from level 3 to 5, and unit numbers skip 103 to 105, etc.

What a superstition to follow in Sydney.

four [æ­»] == ðŸ’€
