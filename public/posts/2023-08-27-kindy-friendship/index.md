Kindergarten, or "kindy", is the first year of schooling in Australia.
My daughter started her kindy early this year at the age of five.

Who gets to be her best friends or which friends she ends up playing with the most is not up to the child.
It's pretty much dependent on the parents.

Friendships in kindy are determined and maintained by how well both sets of parents get along with each other, rather than by how much the kids themselves like each other.

We have avoided parents who exhibit certain traits in parenting that are incompatible to ours.
Likewise, we may have been the ones others tried not to mingle with.
