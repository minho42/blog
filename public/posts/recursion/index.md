I didn't really understand the foundational mechanisms that made up the storyline, such as why two timelines merge and have false memory syndromes, what happens to the previous life/memory, etc.

Reminded me of other works such as:
- Minority Report
- All You Need Is Kill 
- Groundhog Day

Very interesting concept of time travelling nonetheless.
Enjoyed Blake's fiction again.
Highly appraise his creativity.
