Sci-fi writer Andy Weir says in his interview with Adam Grant ([link](https://youtu.be/EEuoZrlLfgo?si=R08oJNGH4pINm0wE) 21:45):

- "the nearest life might be like two million light years away"
- "They are too far away"

I totally agree with this view.

- There are 200 billion to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe.
- Each galaxy has 100 billion stars.
- Solar system is just a speck in the Milky Way Galaxy.
- Nearest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, is 4.2 light-years away.

It is indeed too far away.
Without factoring all the theories [why we haven't found aliens](https://youtu.be/dTjgrG2UY30?si=AO2RCnhHNBm0HVkj), the distance alone is the greatest factor of all in my opinion.
