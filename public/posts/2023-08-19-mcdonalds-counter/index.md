I do a lot of afternoon shift. 
Having early dinner (dinner break starting from 5 p.m) or skipping dinner makes me crave something to eat after work.
There aren't many options after 10 p.m except the fast-food giant.
It is especially tempting after a stressful shift.
Somehow, watching YouTube videos munching chips and burgers became a way to release a bit of steam and I enjoyed the short alone moment in the car. Then it sort of became a habit.
Many days, I would just go straight to drive-through despite not feeling hungry.

I noticed myself going to McDonald's a lot over the recent years.
I would like to turn around the trend and try not to go if I'm not hungry.
