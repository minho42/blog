I just migrated this static blog from Netlify to Cloudflare Pages to try out.

Thoughts:

Cloudflare has much generous free plan compared to Netlify.
Not that I'm going to reach the limit any time soon.

Not very used to Cloudflare UI to navigate so far. No problem.

Build commands are easily generated by selecting used framework. Awesome. No more checking package.json for each project. Well it feels like this is how it's supposed to be.

Custom domain name settings are the easiest I've tried so far.
Just add `minho42.com` and `www.minho42.com`. Done.

Redirecting www url to non-www isn't obvious without looking up though.
See [how to...](/posts/cloudflare-redirect-with-page-rules)
It was easier with Netlify by setting the primary domain.

Web Analytics is provided for free.

Experience is great.
