I don't think I've ever hit my just-turned-6yo daughter.

But I had been spanking my 2yo son for a while out of frustration or anger.
I don't remember when it started and how long.
He has been always so stubborn fresh out of the womb.
Like father, like son.
Like grandfather, like father.

On 2023-08-01 night, I pledged not to use corporal punishment any more.

Reasons:

- It doesn't work at all but only makes punishment harsh.
- Apparently my nearly 3yo son doesn't know what he's doing.
- I feel really terrible afterwards knowing it's wrong.

I need my wife's pledge not to slap his back too.
