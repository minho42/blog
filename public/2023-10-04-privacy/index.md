"We take your privacy seriously" doesn't mean anything but just an expression.

It all really means:

"We take your privacy. Seriously. We don't need to say we are collecting more information from you than we can function as a business. 
We didn't say it will remain private.
I'm sure you know by now. 
We are ready to say sorry when things go bad because we are not that stupid."
