I have been using Alfred for quickly launching apps, opening Chrome with set urls, and looking for local files.

Recently, I have heard a lot of good reviews about Raycast, a Spotlight/Alfred alternative on Mac.

I tried Raycast few times before.
Each time, I just went back straight to Alfred as I was used to Web Search shortcuts I set in Alfred.

Kept hearing how much of a game changer Raycast is but didn't hear why.

Today, I tried again and I think I can stick to it this time.
Still using Alfred along with Raycast but gave the shortcut `⌘ + space` to Raycast so I can get some used to.

Migrated all Web Search shortcuts from Alfred to Raycast Quicklinks.

Points I like about Raycast after trying for very limited time so far

- Can do pretty much everything I was using Alfred for
- `Quciklinks` \{query} can have default value e.g. \{query:default}
- `Clipboard History` is handy
- Remapped shortcut for emoji popup to Raycast `Search Emoji`; this didn't seem possible with Alfred
  - This solved my VS Code issue of emoji popup unreliably opening at times
- `Hotkey` can be assigned to various operations
- `Alias` can be added on top of Hotkey

Tried to migrate Window management from `ShiftIt` to Raycast as well but couldn't ditch ShiftIt.
Because Raycast wouldn't allow shortcuts with just `fn` + `[...]` without another modifier like [⌘, ⇧, ⌥, ⌃].

> At least one modifier should be included into a hotkey
