### Current writing process
1. Add a short `Todoist` task on iPhone
    - or iPhone `Notes` app when using `Siri`
    - or Google `Keep` if listing goes longer
2. Open this blog repo on `VS Code` when I can open my MacBook
3. Make a draft in `markdown` file in `/posts-draft` (`git` ignored)
4. Add more thoughts if there's anything to say with the help of `ChatGPT`, `Google`, and `Dictionary`
5. Move the file into `/posts` once barely ready
6. Commit
7. Edit
